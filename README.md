# üìä Research Projects Database

This project is a relational database designed to manage and track research projects, employees involved, funding agencies, and managerial responsibilities. The database schema is modeled using an Entity-Relationship approach and implemented in SQL.

- A **funding agency** can fund multiple **projects**, but each **project** is funded by exactly one **agency**
- Project names are **unique within each agency**



## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Features Used
- Primary & Foreign Key constraints
- Composite keys (via `employee_project`)
- Normalized schema
- One-to-one and many-to-many relationship modeling
